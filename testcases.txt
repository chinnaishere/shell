416 Project 3 Test Cases
Janelle Barcia, Nikolay Feldman
1.Empty Command #1 (new line)
-new line prompt shows ($)
2. Empty Command #2 (spaces and tabs with new line)
-new line prompt shows ($)
3. Exit on the end of the file (control D)
-exits cleanly
4. A shell prompt for each line of input
-prompt on line of imput
5. No shell prompt if the standard input is not a terminal ((echo echo abc;echo echo def;echo echo ghi)|./shell)
-three processes/abc def ghi prints successfully
6. The shell should run a simple command with arguments
-echo hello, world (outputs hello, world with process)
7. The shell should print an exit code for each process that terminates.
-prints process with exit for each process
8. Handle too many arguments gracefully, ex: echo a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z
-error code is printed for too many args
9.Quotes should be handled properly (echo "abc" "def" 'ghi' 'jkl')
-outputs as expected, abc def ghi jkl outputs
10. Spaces within quotes should be parsed correctly. (./echoargs 'abc def ghi' "j     k   l‚Äù)
-correct output, argc arg[0] arg[1] arg[2] show
11. Mismatched quote, ex: echo 'abc
-error message printed and exited
12. Mismatched quote 2, ex: echo 'abc"
-error message printed and exited
13. Single Pipe command should work, ex: ls -laF /|tr a-z A-Z
-prints successfully
14. Pipeline of three command should work, ex: ls -alF  / | grep bin | cat -n
-prints successfully
15. Pipeline of more than three commands should work, ex: ls -alF  / | grep bin | tr a-z 'A-Z' |rev|cat -n
-prints successfully
16. The cd command should work with one argument, ex: cd /etc
-prints successfully
17. cd command should work with no arguments, ex: cd pwd prints home directory
-prints successfully
18. cd command should barf when given more than one argument, ex: cd /etc /home
-error message printed
19. The exit command should exit with no arguments
-exits successfully
20. The exit command should exit with an argument, ex: exit 123
-exits successfully and prints 123
21. Check that the shell is able to accept at least 10 commands, ex: (typeset -i i;i=0;while [ $i -lt 10 ];do echo echo $i;i=i+1;done)|./myshell
-all 10 process for each command print and exit successfully
22. Shell accepts at least 1000 commands (typeset -i i;i=0;while [ $i -lt 1000 ];do echo echo $i;i=i+1;done)|./myshell)
-all 1000 processes for each command print and exit successfully
